Create a dapp that allows you to enter a contract address (or search in a curated list)
once found it, reads its ABI and presents functional components to call functions/read values
also displays plots and statistics about it.
Usage is to validate smart contracts and operate with them.
pain point: calling from metamask. Since idk the functions that are gonna be called. Study the case of creating a tx, pushing it and sign it from metamaks in the browser.
